From the Pinnecronomicon:

Skill Shot: It is difficult but possible to plunge into the saucer that moves the ball to the upper playfield. The shot is just above and to the left of the left most top lane.

Kick Back relight: Saucer located between the pop bumpers.

Strategy: Playing the upper playfield is the safest strategy. You can get to the upper playfield on a plunge but, to get back to the upper playfield you need to qualify at least one rider. To qualify a rider you need to complete same colored targets and features on the playfield. Yellow targets, Green top lanes, Blue targets, Orange/Red targets. Once you have a rider qualified shoot the spinner shot to move the ball to the backbox playfield. Shooting the lit rider shot makes progress towards MB but, you will have to qualify another rider to make it back to the upper playfield which is what you don't want. Instead avoid the rider shot and shoot the ABC. The ABC will double the top most shot in the backbox called red hot. Every time the red hot shot is made 25k will be added to the shot. So ideally you want to make it to the backbox, complete ABC and make it to the red hot shot as many times as possible.

MB: This MB is difficult to start and impossible to complete. You first have to collect all of the rider targets on the lower playfield. Then, complete each riders shot in the upper playfield. Once complete, lock will light in the upper playfield. After you shoot the lock MB starts after the ball is plunged. During MB the first shot needed is the saucer between the pop bumpers. The ball will stay in the saucer on a timer. Shoot the second ball to the backbox playfield and hit the captive ball from the upper flipper.
