Pinnecronomicon says: "Strategy: Shoot the left orbit for combo pts bonus, theater letters, bonus x trap on right flipper and repeat. After you spell theater shoot box for hurry up value. Shoot ramps to spell magic and enable locks. Once locks are enabled shoot inner loop to lock balls. Shoot box to start MB. Shoot Box for Jackpots and to relight jackpot."
