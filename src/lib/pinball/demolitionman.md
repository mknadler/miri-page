From the Pinnecronomicon:

Strategy: Combos score a TON of points. R inlane lights QuickFreeze (virtual lock). Collect QF(s) on L ramp, and start mb via L inner loop.

MB: Flashing shots are JP's and hitting both of the triggers and top buttons on the grips awards a jackpot for free, SuperJP usually on R ramp.

Claw; Select QF second from the left if you have a "start mb" lit -- it instantly starts your mb. If you don't have MB lit it will award a QF toward your next mb which should light the start MB insert at the left inner loop.
